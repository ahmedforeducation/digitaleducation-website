        <p>        Digital education has transformed learning, making it more accessible and flexible. However, it comes with several challenges that impact students, teachers, and institutions.
        <br>
        One major challenge is the digital divideâ€”many students lack access to reliable internet and devices, limiting their ability to participate in online learning. This issue is especially significant in rural or low-income areas, where technology is expensive or unavailable.    
        <br>
        Another challenge is lack of engagement and motivation. Traditional classrooms provide direct interaction with teachers and peers, which helps students stay focused. In contrast, online learning can feel isolating, leading to decreased motivation and participation.
        <br>
        Additionally, technical issues can disrupt learning. Poor internet connections, software glitches, and cybersecurity threats can cause frustration and delays, making digital education less efficient.
        <br>
        Furthermore, teacher training and adaptation pose challenges. Many educators are not fully equipped with digital teaching skills, making it difficult to create interactive and effective lessons.
        <br>
        Lastly, assessing students fairly in digital education is complex. Online exams raise concerns about cheating, and evaluating practical skills can be difficult.
        <br>
        While digital education offers many benefits, addressing these challenges is essential to ensure equal, effective, and engaging learning experiences for all students.
